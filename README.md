- 👋 Hi, I’m @caminolow I am in PR/Production/Digital Creative Campaigns.  I believe that life experiences lead us to certain places in life and no matter what your story
or history, I have my own past, that I can't talk about, so if you are down to discuss collaborate and figure out a plan for a business, organization, etc I believe struggle in life, is what gives us grit, authenticity, and I don't dwell on the past, I want to find like minded individuals to collaborate with and build something thats our own!!
Right now my life feels like its spinning as I am trying to create a new business that I am looking to find several partners (which I have a few ideas about collaborating on a global business that I have not fully worked out but I know if we had 4 people and a solid idea we can create something not done before. If you are someone one can count on and are passionate about a media type project that pushes into a new way to develop a business from the ground up, if you work in PR, Media Relations, Public Awareness, Non profit, for profit marketing, are a smooth point person that is a great communitcator, organized, intellegent, hungry, if your a hustler, I want to show the world that for example, a PR Director, innovator, journalist, social media marketer, social media influencer, skilled with computer skills that few people understand, ambitious.
I dont know if it's just me or the technology is super hard to keep up with and so I have to evolve and learn.  
- 👀 I’m interested in ...growing a business that goes against most companies norms. I want to have a crew that is invested and want it to succeed as much as myself.
I hate greed but well money is a necessity to build. I am interested in doing passion projects and working with intelligent people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...non profit program, as well as juggling learning how to increase my skill set. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... A project that those I collaborate with share a similar idea or principal of "let's all profit and do shit we love" 
as well as Create our own passion projects and then also work for others as a team and become a valuable business:)
I really encourage those who may not think they are a good fit, but look I dont care what your background is as long as your straight now.
